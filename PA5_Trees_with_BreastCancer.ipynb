        "For this programming assignment, you will be working with the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. This dataset contains various measurements of the size and shape of tumors, along with the diagnosis of the tumor as benign or malignant. Further information on this dataset can be found here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+(diagnostic). Our goal is to train a tree-based model that can use the measurements of a tumor to diagnosis it as benign or malignant.\n",
