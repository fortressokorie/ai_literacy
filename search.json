    "text": "Chapter 3: Rules for Working with AI\nIn Chapter 3, Mollick introduces four rules for working with AI:\n\nAlways invite AI to the table\nBe the human in the loop\nTreat AI like a person (but tell it what kind of person it is)\nAssume this is the worst AI you will ever use\n\n\nHow, if at all, would you revise these rules?\n\nWhat would you add or subtract?\n\nDo you think these rules make sense for the purpose of figuring out how to incorporate AI tools into our classrooms?\nIf you already make use of AI tools (particularly Generative AI tools), what are some of your own personal rules for working with AI?\n\nWhy do you consider those rules important?\n\nWhat rules would you make for student use of Generative AI?\n\n\n\n\nChapter 5: “The Button” and the Blank Page\nIn Chapter 5, Mollick writes:\n\n“When faced with the tyranny of the blank page, people are going to push The Button. It is so much easier to start with something than with nothing. Students are going to use it to start essays…. Everyone is going to use The Button” (119).\n\n\nIs using The Button inherently bad, or is there an argument to be made for allowing students to use Generative AI as a brainstorming tool and to support higher-level planning and thinking?\nWhat do we gain or lose by going one way or the other on this issue?\n\nMollick goes on to write:\n\n“When we use AI to generate our first drafts, we tend to anchor on the first idea the machine produces, which influences our future work” (119).\n\n\nSuppose we limit the generation to just a list of ideas as opposed to a draft.\n\nWould you revise any of your previous answers?\n\nDo you agree or disagree with the following statement?\n\n\nIn general, the incorporation of Generative AI tools into classes will hinder students from developing their own unique style (whether it’s writing—essays or proofs—or even just the way they think and reason through problems).\n\n\n\n\nAI, Creativity, and Meaningful Work\nIn his discussion of AI as a creative tool, Mollick argues:\n\n“A lot of work is time-consuming by design. In a world in which the AI gives an instant, pretty good, near-universally accessible shortcut, we’ll soon face a crisis of meaning in creative work of all kinds. This is, in part, because we expect creative work to take careful thought and revision, but also that time often operates as a stand-in for work” (120).\n\n\nIf time is no longer a reliable proxy for effort, what might be some of the markers we should use to assess:\n\nQuality?\nSincerity?\n\nHow does this translate to an academic context?\nHow do we maintain trust between faculty and students that work is not being outsourced inappropriately to GenAI models?\n\n\n\n\nCointelligence and Subject Matter Expertise\nMollick describes a powerful tension between access to AI outputs across domains and the ability to properly work with those outputs as “cointelligence.” He writes:\n\n“The issue is that in order to learn to think critically, problem-solve, understand abstract concepts, reason through novel problems, and evaluate the AI’s output, we need subject matter expertise” (181).\n\n\nWhat might be some of the implications of this tension for universities and colleges?\nAs a faculty member, how would you define subject matter expertise?\nAs a student, how would you define subject matter expertise?\nA student is very unlikely to have subject matter expertise in a course they are actively enrolled in.\n\nGiven this, are there ways to meaningfully incorporate AI use into classrooms that support learning and growth?\nCan AI assist students in developing subject matter expertise as you define it?\n\n\n\n\n\nAI, Tutoring, and the Future of Teaching\nBenjamin Bloom’s 1984 paper “The 2 Sigma Problem” showed that students receiving one-to-one tutoring performed two standard deviations better than those in conventional classroom settings. Bloom challenged educators to find scalable methods that could achieve similar results.\nMollick writes:\n\n“This is where AI comes in… AI will reshape how we teach and learn, both in schools and after we leave them… They won’t replace teachers but will make classrooms more necessary… and they will destroy the way we teach before they improve it” (160).\n\n\nWhat changes are you already feeling or seeing in the classroom—as students or as teachers?\n\nMollick also writes:\n\n“Education has changed remarkably little for centuries… Students do homework to practice what they’ve learned and then get tested to ensure they’ve retained their knowledge… research shows that both homework and tests are remarkably useful learning tools… So, it’s a blow that the first impact of LLMs was to usher in the homework apocalypse” (161).\n\n\n\n\nTrust, Assessment, and Academic Integrity\nThere is no reliable way to detect whether a piece of text is AI-generated. Research has shown that AI detectors have extremely high false positive rates, especially for non-native English speakers.\n\nHow do we maintain trust between faculty and students in a world where, unless work is produced in class, there is no accurate way to determine whether it is human-created?\nFor classes where knowledge cannot be meaningfully assessed through timed exams, what are some broad-stroke ways to ensure core learning objectives are being met?\n\nFeel free to be general or discipline-specific.\n\nEvery school and instructor must define acceptable AI use.\n\nChoose a specific discipline and describe:\n\nWhat acceptable AI use might look like\n\nWhat unacceptable AI use would be\n\n\nJustify your reasoning.\n\n\n\n\n\nCall to Action\nMollick ends the book with a call to action:\n\n“The thing about a widely applicable technology is that decisions about how it is used are not limited to a small group of people… We can’t wait for decisions to be made for us, and the world is advancing too fast to remain passive” (210).\n\n\n\nFinal Reflection\nAssume Mollick is correct and that you play a role in shaping what AI means for your institution and for higher education.\n\nWhat will you commit to doing in the next weeks and months to respond to this call?\nHow can we collectively support one another in doing this work?\n\nThink long and hard about this question—we will return to it in our third session."

    "text": "An analysis from Axios’ Megan Morrone shows that after initial resistance, institutions of learning are becoming more accepting of the idea of the integration of AI tools into the teaching and learning process. Driving the decline in resistance is the emerging idea that these tools are here to stay, and avoiding integrating them could leave students unprepared for life after college (think work). There is no doubt that these tools will transform the nature of teaching and learning at all levels of education. The hard part is figuring out how to balance fears of academic dishonesty with ensuring that students continue to develop critical thinking and other mission-relevant skills that support holistic learning.\nThe first goal of this independent study is to understand current attitudes within our community towards the integration of AI tools into the teaching and learning process here at our college.\nThe second goal of this independent study is to invite faculty and students into a dialogue that helps build a consensus around what constitutes meaningful integration of AI tools into the teaching and learning experience here at St. Olaf, both at a school-wide level and at the level of individual disciplines and individual classrooms. We hope that this dialogue helps build an understanding of the arguments for and against, as well as reflection on the thorny ethical issues that come with such integration. We hope that the culmination of that dialogue is a “common core” set of best practices that maximizes trust between faculty and students in the classroom.\nFinally, tbd\nPeople and Resources\n\nArtwork: The Myth of Zhuangzi by Yeachin Tsai"
