The AI Literacy in Education sessions are a series of public-facing discussions developed as part of a **Spring 2026 independent study project by Fortress Okorie** focused on understanding how generative artificial intelligence is transforming teaching and learning in higher education. 

As AI tools become increasingly present in academic life, faculty and students alike are navigating new questions about how these technologies should be used (or not) and regulated in classroom settings. This project creates a shared space for dialogue, recognizing that meaningful AI literacy requires not only technical knowledge but also thoughtful reflection on teaching pedagogy, ethics, and personal and institutional values.

Across three sessions, participants will explore both practical and conceptual dimensions of generative AI in education. The first session, GenAI and the Future of Teaching and Learning, examines how AI is already reshaping classroom practices and the ways knowledge is created, communicated, and assessed. Guided in part by ideas from Ethan Mollick’s Co-Intelligence, the discussion invites participants to consider how AI might augment or transform teaching methods and student learning, without requiring prior familiarity with the material.

The second session, Ethics, Trust, and Transparency in GenAI Use, focuses on the ethical and relational challenges raised by AI in academic contexts. This session continues to be guided by ideas from Mollick’s Co-Intelligence, as well as articles by Tyler Kingkade of NBC and Cornelia Walther of the Wharton School of Business. Participants will tackle questions centered around responsible use, disclosure, and academic integrity, as well as the role of trust between students and faculty. This session emphasizes the importance of fairness, accountability, and clear communication as institutions adapt to rapidly evolving technologies.

The final session, Building a Shared Framework for GenAI at St. Olaf, serves as a collaborative workshop in which students and faculty work together to articulate discipline-specific needs, share emerging practices, and voice concerns. The hope is to enable all voices to contribute constructively to ongoing campus conversations about the future of education in the age of AI.

Taken together, these sessions aim to foster AI literacy as a collective, community-based practice,  grounded in dialogue and respect for diverse pedagogical approaches. By centering both student and faculty perspectives, this project seeks to support more intentional, transparent, and equitable decisions about how generative AI is used in teaching and learning at St. Olaf.
