You will focus on applying unsupervised learning techniques, specifically K-means clustering, to see if the algorithm can naturally identify patterns that correspond to different clothing categories. You will also critically evaluate the performance of clustering against the ground truth labels and reflect on the limitations of the algorithm.\n",
