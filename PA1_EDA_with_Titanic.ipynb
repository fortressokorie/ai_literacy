For Task 1, you are to generate Python code to analyze and summarize the Titanic dataset given a prompt for a genAI model. For Task 2, you will critique the generated program by identifying three areas of improvement. For Task 3, you will implement the improvements you identified. For Task 4, you will create two publication-style visualizations that tell a story. For Task 5, you will reflect on this assignment.\n",
