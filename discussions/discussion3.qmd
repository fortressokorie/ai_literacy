title: "Session 3: Building a Shared Framework for GenAI at St. Olaf"
format: html
---
## Overview 
This final session is a collaborative brainstorming workshop bringing together 
students and faculty to co-create visions for responsible and effective GenAI use at St.
Olaf. Participants will share discipline-specific needs, successful practices, and 
concerns, and work toward developing a set of common core principles for AI use across 
courses and departments. The ideas generated will be synthesized into a publicly shared 
document as a product of this project, aiming to contribute constructively to ongoing 
campus conversations about AI rather than replace existing efforts.


## Meeting Date and Location
**Thursday, March 19th in RNS 356 from 11:30 to 12:30 CST**

Note: Due to scheduling difficulties this session will occur over a SOAR session.

## Discussion Questions

### Call to Action and Final Reflection

Mollick ends the book with a call to action:

> “The thing about a widely applicable technology is that decisions about how it is used are not limited to a small group of people… We can’t wait for decisions to be made for us, and the world is advancing too fast to remain passive” (210).

Assume Mollick is correct and that you play a role in shaping what AI means for your institution and for higher education.

1. What will you commit to doing in the next weeks and months to respond to this call?
2. How can we collectively support one another in doing this work?
