title: "Session 3: Building a Shared Framework for GenAI at St. Olaf"
format: html
---
## Overview 
This final session is a collaborative brainstorming workshop bringing together 
students and faculty to co-create visions for responsible and effective GenAI use at St.
Olaf. Participants will share discipline-specific needs, successful practices, and 
concerns, and work toward developing a set of common core principles for AI use across 
courses and departments. The ideas generated will be synthesized into a publicly shared 
document as a product of this project, aiming to contribute constructively to ongoing 
campus conversations about AI rather than replace existing efforts.
