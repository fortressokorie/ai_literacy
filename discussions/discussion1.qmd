## Overview 
How do we see AI affecting and transforming education? (GenAI and the future of teaching and learning). We'd have Co-Intelligence as our main reference material, with a few extra things I'm still pulling together. Thinking this could also be a good session to launch a survey in. Will share more about what our current survey looks like when we meet in person again.
