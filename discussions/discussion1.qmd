format: html
---
## Overview 
This session explores how generative AI is reshaping education and what that means 
for teaching and learning. Using Co-Intelligence by Ethan Mollick as a guiding text, 
we will examine how AI tools may augment or transform classroom practices, the way 
faculty impart knowledge, and the way students engage with the learning process. 
The discussion will focus on practical and conceptual questions about how AI is already 
influencing higher education and where it may be headed. No prior reading is required - 
discussion questions are designed to provide all relevant context, 
so all participants can engage meaningfully regardless of familiarity with the material.

## Reading Materials
- Co-intelligence: living and working with AI by Ethan Mollick. 

## Meeting Date and Location
**Thursday, February 19th in RNS 356 from 11:30 to 12:30 CST**

Note: This is not during either SOAR discussions nor faculty meetings

## Discussion Questions

### Chapter 3: Rules for Working with AI

In Chapter 3, Mollick introduces four rules for working with AI:

- Always invite AI to the table
- Be the human in the loop
- Treat AI like a person (but tell it what kind of person it is)
- Assume this is the worst AI you will ever use


1. How, if at all, would you revise these rules?  
   - What would you add or subtract?

2. Do you think these rules make sense for the purpose of figuring out how to or if we should incorporate AI tools into our classrooms?

3. If you already make use of AI tools (particularly Generative AI tools), what are some of your own personal rules for working with AI?  
   - Why do you consider those rules important?

4. What rules would you make for student use of Generative AI?

### Chapter 5: “The Button” and the Blank Page

Referring to GenAI as "The Button", in Chapter 5, Mollick writes:

> “When faced with the tyranny of the blank page, people are going to push *The Button*. It is so much easier to start with something than with nothing. Students are going to use it to start essays…. Everyone is going to use *The Button*” (119).

1. Is using *The Button* inherently bad, or is there an argument to be made for allowing students to use Generative AI as a brainstorming tool and to support higher-level planning and thinking?

2. What do we gain or lose by going one way or the other on this issue?

3. Mollick explores the idea that some people naturally have more or better ideas than others and that GenAI tools can help close this "idea generation gap". Suppose we limit the generation to just a list of ideas as opposed to a draft. Would you revise any of your previous answers?

Mollick goes on to write:

> “When we use AI to generate our first drafts, we tend to anchor on the first idea the machine produces, which influences our future work” (119).

4. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?

> *In general, the incorporation of Generative AI tools into classes will hinder students from developing their own unique style (whether it’s writing—essays or proofs—or even just the way they think and reason through problems).*

### Cointelligence and Subject Matter Expertise

Mollick describes a powerful tension between access to AI outputs across domains and the ability to properly work with those outputs as **“cointelligence.”** He writes:

> “The issue is that in order to learn to think critically, problem-solve, understand abstract concepts, reason through novel problems, and evaluate the AI’s output, we need subject matter expertise” (181).


1. What might be some of the implications of this tension for universities and colleges?

2. As a faculty member, how would you define **subject matter expertise**?

3. As a student, how would you define **subject matter expertise**?

4. A student is very unlikely to have subject matter expertise in a course they are actively enrolled in.  
   - Given this, are there ways to meaningfully incorporate AI use into classrooms that support learning and growth?
   - Can AI assist students in developing subject matter expertise as you define it?

### AI, Tutoring, and the Future of Teaching

Benjamin Bloom’s 1984 paper *“The 2 Sigma Problem”* showed that students receiving one-to-one tutoring performed two standard deviations better than those in conventional classroom settings. Bloom challenged educators to find scalable methods that could achieve similar results.

Mollick writes:

> “This is where AI comes in… AI will reshape how we teach and learn, both in schools and after we leave them… They won't replace teachers but will make classrooms more necessary… and they will destroy the way we teach before they improve it” (160).

1. What changes are you already feeling or seeing in the classroom—as students or as teachers?
