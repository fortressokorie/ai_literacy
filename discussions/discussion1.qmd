title: "Session 1: GenAI and the Future of Teaching & Learning"
format: html
---
## Overview 
This session explores how generative AI is reshaping education and what that means 
for teaching and learning. Using Co-Intelligence by Ethan Mollick as a guiding text, 
we will examine how AI tools may augment or transform classroom practices, the way 
faculty impart knowledge, and the way students engage with the learning process. 
The discussion will focus on practical and conceptual questions about how AI is already 
influencing higher education and where it may be headed. No prior reading is required - 
discussion questions are designed to provide all relevant context, 
so all participants can engage meaningfully regardless of familiarity with the material.
