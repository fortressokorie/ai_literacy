format: html
---
## Overview 
This session centers on the ethical challenges of using generative AI in 
classroom/learning settings. We will discuss issues of trust between students and 
faculty, responsible use of AI tools, and the ethics of disclosure when syllabi lack 
clear AI policies. Participants will consider questions such as: When is AI use 
appropriate? How should expectations be communicated? What does academic integrity 
mean in an age of AI assistance? Through guided discussion, we will explore how 
classrooms can balance innovation with fairness, accountability, and mutual trust.
