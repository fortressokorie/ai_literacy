## Overview 
Here, we can think about the Ethics of GenAI use in a classroom setting. Detection tools suck and are biased, so what are we going to do? When should we disclose/ How should we disclose? What constitutes academic dishonesty? This is a really good resource to that point from The Wharton School of Business. Thinking about trust and social exchange theory, and how we can build those things up in GenAI-assisted learning.
