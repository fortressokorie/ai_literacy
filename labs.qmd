Each lab will be completed with a lab partner. 
The group can decide which member is the recorder (copies the colab workbook and notetakes) and the researcher (searchs documentation, slide decks, class materials).
The recorder should submit a clickable link to the Moodle submission by the next lecture.

## Lab: INTRO 
In this lab, we explore how to build our own Python dictionaries and functions to store and summarize data. 
Using a national policing dataset, we examine the impact of policing on Black Americans.

## Lab: EDA
In this lab, we will explore how to critic and refine code outputted by a language model, and practice a bit of prompt engineering.
We will be using the Titanic dataset to perform exploratory data analysis tasks, 
including calculating statistical measures, conducting statistical tests, and creating visualizations.

## Lab: EVL
In this lab, we will explore the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset and focus on key aspects of model evaluation and resampling techniques. 
We will comment on the complexity of chosen models in a developed workflow, discuss resampling techniques, as well as the implications on various evaluation metrics. 
The lab finishes with auditing the algorithms using the ethical matrix framework discussed in class.

## Lab: CLS
In this lab, we will be working with image data and exploring how decisions made in the modeling workflow impact
results for our clustering models. There are a selection of open-ended questions (give your best guess on these)
along with implementing some aspects of the clustering algorithm with functions that you build.
