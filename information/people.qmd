**Fortress Okorie** 

Hi, I’m a junior majoring in Mathematics and Quantitative Economics with a concentration in Statistics and Data Science. When I’m not thinking about data, I’m usually diving into history and historical fiction (World Wars, Cold War, and Financial History) or exploring public policy (particularly technology and education policy). In my non-existent free time, I enjoy logic puzzles and games with intriguing math properties (yes, I’m a blast at parties). I’m excited to explore the impact of GenAI with you and to be a part of conversation about what it can mean for the teaching and learning experience here at St. Olaf.
