**Fortress Okorie** 

Fortress is a junior majoring in Mathematics and Quantitative Economics, with a concentration in Statistics and Data Science. When he’s not thinking about data, he’s usually diving into history and historical fiction, especially the World Wars, the Cold War, and financial history, or exploring public policy, with a particular interest in technology and education. In his (mostly imaginary) free time, he enjoys logic puzzles and detective mystery games. He’s excited to explore the impact of GenAI with you and to be part of the conversation about what it could mean for teaching and learning at St. Olaf.
