Hi, my name is Fortress Okorie. I am a current junior majoring in Mathematics and Quantitative Economics with a concentration in Statistics and Data Science. Since I'm almost never not thinking about math, stats, or econ, I've learned to balance that with reading a lot about everything with a particular interest in history (WW2, Cold War, Financial, Pan-African) and publci policy (technology, education). 
In my (non-existent) free time, I'm a big fan of logic puzzles and any game that has fun math or econ properties I can investigate (I am indeed the life of the party). I'm really excited to have you join me in exploring the impact GenAI is having on our collective teaching and learning experience and I hope that together we can come up with a meaningful framework that positively impacts the teaching and learning experiences of Oles.
